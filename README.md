## Color Palette Description

**#aea16a (Muted Gold)** ![#aea16a](https://placehold.co/15x15/aea16a/aea16a.png)

Acts as a soft, brushed metallic or "aged brass" accent. In 2025, shiny golds are being replaced by these matte, subdued tones to provide a subtle luxury without being flashy. 

**#c9bb9b (Warm Sand)** ![#c9bb9b](https://placehold.co/15x15/c9bb9b/c9bb9b.png)

A classic neutral that bridges the gap between the darker browns and the lighter highlights.

**#735d36 (Raw Umber)** ![#735d36](https://placehold.co/15x15/735d36/735d36.png)

A mid-tone brown with olive undertones that adds depth and a vintage feel and singaling objects like pinecones, and acorns. It adds a "woodsy" depth that grounds the lighter colors.

**#3e3625 (Dark Espresso)** ![#3e3625](https://placehold.co/15x15/3e3625/3e3625.png)

The anchor of the palette. It provides necessary contrast and can be used for text or structural elements.

**#ddd (Light Gray)** ![#ddd](https://placehold.co/15x15/ddd/ddd.png)

Acts as a clean "breath of air", the "wintry" highlight, reminiscent of frost or a snowy day.
